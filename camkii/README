This demonstration fits a model of CamKII to a previous models results
First, need to verify previous results - phospho CamKII activation versus frequency of CamCa4 pulses
1. start with original NeuroRD - ensure v2 still gives those results
   ---> Yes, for 1 hz (2.3 uM) and 2.5hz (6.1 uM), but 4 Hz sitmulation not working
2. Using reactions from Asia's model were not giving correct results.  Compared to original files
   a. Old Stim files and CamOut nicely gave 100 nM CamCa4 pulses - replace the current CamBuf approach
   b. Several rates differed between original and model used by Asia - went back to those rates
     Kb for Cam binding CK was 3e-3, changed back to 1.5e-3
     kf for CKCam becoming complex and CKpCam becoming pComplex was 0.1e-6, changed back to 4e-8
   c. Now, Old NeuroRD (v2) and new NeuroRD (v3) give same results when using same reaction & IC files
   ---> 1 hz (2.3 uM), 2.5Hz (6.1uM), 4Hz: 8.5 uM
2. Evaluate effect of smaller morphology - using CKold
   --> same results, but smaller volume is faster - use it
    a. depth2D=0.5 (4x4 morph) vol=8 time=6.6s 6.4s 5.9s 16:10.8 (0 Hz)!!!!
    b. depth2D=2.0 (1x1 morph) vol=2 time=2.2s 1.9s 1.8s 3:51 (0 Hz)
3. Update CKnew files using CamOut instead of CamBuf in Rxn, also new stim files and IC
   ---> Done
4. Re-do optimization - exclude 0Hz - takes too long.  Instead, after CamKII parameters are optimized, do 0 Hz optimization with parameters of PP1 dephos CKpCamCa4
5. Possibly include models with 6s of constant stimulation at different CamCa4 concentrations, and use original De Koninck and Shulman data (instead of model)

NEXT:
A. Repeat with no CK3_fwd_rate (lowest value among all 3d order rxn) and no CK2+CKp2 (10x lower than other 4th order rxn): NO GOOD.  no CK3_fwd_rate, but yes CK2+CKp2: Good, but not as good as all 6 params
-----> Try these 5 terms when fit to De Koninck and Shulman data directly.  

6 params:
CK2_fwd_rate = 4.7823028386e-10
CK4_fwd_rate = 2.40494172326e-16
CK3_fwd_rate = 1.38777893838e-14
CK1_CKp2_fwd_rate = 1.79055711331e-13
CK2_CKp1_fwd_rate = 1.10780018648e-12
CK2_CKp2_fwd_rate = 2.20407769483e-17

5 params:
CK2_fwd_rate = 3.08315018424e-12  diff
CK4_fwd_rate = 2.42392335481e-16 same
CK1_CKp2_fwd_rate = 5.06346604628e-17 diff
CK2_CKp2_fwd_rate = 1.84247133684e-20 diff
CK2_CKp1_fwd_rate = 1.48099763646e-12 diff

B. Use 6 param model to tune PP1 for 0 Hz -

RESULTS
1. initial opt converged at min fitness of 0.0687 (within 200 iteractions), but CKpCamCa4 is not stable - it is increasing					previous values:
CKpCamPP1_fwd_rate = 2.839e-05 +/- 7.8638e-05 	    0.0003e-6 = slower - 10x lower than for CKp
CKpCamPP1_bak_rate = 0.408 +/- 0.001274		    0.034e-3 = 10,000x slower - 10x lower than for CKp
CKpCamPP1_kcat_rate = 4.849e-09 +/- 5.82477e-10	    0.0086e-3 = 8.6e-6 - 1000x faster - 10x lower than for CKp
KM: 14376	      		    		    KM=142 uM

Asia: kf=4e-9,kb=0.34e-3,kcat=0.086e-3 same for CKp and CKpCamCa4, Km=106 uM
BUT, in Myung determ model: Km=5.1 uM  from foulkes et al., Eur. JBiochem.1983 132(309-313))
Vmax=5.7 umol/min --> kcat=3.5 sec-1 = 3.5e-3/msec
Simonelli 1984(Grad Thesis,CUNY) showed that other substrates are about 1/10 the rate -> 0.35e-3 for Kcat
Thus, in determ model: Kf=.039e-6, Kb=.34e-3, Kcat=0.086e-3 for CKp only, KM=10.9 uM
in Myung Stoch model:kf= 0.6e-9, kb=0.34e-3, kcat=0.086e-3 same for CKp and CKpCamCa4, KM=710 uM
Kf lowered drastically, affinity way too low compared to measurements - may be another REF?

2. Inc Kf for pp1 bind CKp, repeat opt of PP1 bind CKpCam with constraint on bak_rate for comp stability

RESULTS: Beautiful match, CKpCamCa4 stable at ~1 uM
CKpCamPP1_fwd_rate = 7.6370842301e-10 +/- 4.31271119437e-13 - 0.764e-9
CKpCamPP1_bak_rate = 0.000638328525746 +/- 6.89791978681e-08 - 0.638e-3
CKpCamPP1_kcat_rate = 0.000121185711888 +/- 1.27429395141e-08 - 0.121e-3
KM=993846 = 994 uM - still too high.

Since CKpCamCa4 is still drifting up slightly, could try simulation with higher Kf, e.g. 2x or 4x (though affinity may not have been measured for CamCa4 bound CKp)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Adjust rates in Rxn file and run one simulation
RESULTS: 2x kf is too high - CKpCamCa4 drifts down from 1 uM
         1.5x kf is perfect - CKpCamCa4 remains at 1 uM for 900 sec.

C. Develop stim files for item 5 above and repeat entire process - are results better?
D. Repeat best simulations with different random seed - are parameters different?
